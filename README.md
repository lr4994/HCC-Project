# A Simulated Password Study 
## Part of course project [CAP5108-Human Centered Computing](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/class/cap5108sp18/)

Project members: Muhammad Sajidur Rahman, Ramesh Lakshman

In this project, we compare the usability and security of text password created or used on mobile devices  to those created or used on traditional devices. For password policy, we chose 3class12 which requires at least three different character classes and a minimum length of twelve. Our overall methodology is based on techniques presented in this paper ['Usability and Security of Text Passwords on Mobile Devices'](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858384). Our findings from the study can be found in [this report](https://sajidrahman.github.io/static/password-study-final-report.pdf).

This repository contains the codebase (both clientside and serverside) we developed and used for conducting the study. You can use this for your project or research. Your acknowledgement of our work in your report/research is highly appreciated.
